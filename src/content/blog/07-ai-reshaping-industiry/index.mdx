The other day, I had a discussion with a colleague about how AI is transforming the tech landscape. As we brainstormed, I was surprised by some of the thoughts we had during the conversation, and I felt compelled to write them down and share my opinion on where I think we’re headed. Although I sure the following might be invalid within next few weeks considering the speed at which we have new AI revolutions coming

## 1. The Rise of Software Architects Over Developers

With AI taking over the execution part of coding, I believe we’ll see a shift in team dynamics. There will be more **software architects** than traditional development engineers in the market.

- AI significantly reduces development time, which means the focus will shift to **making the right choices**: selecting the best tools, frameworks, and databases, and **connecting them efficiently** to build high-performance systems.
- Every engineer will be expected to understand these decisions deeply. It won’t just be about writing code anymore but knowing **how to architect solutions** that AI can then execute.

> Think of it like building a house. If AI is the construction crew that follows instructions perfectly, then engineers will become the architects and planners, deciding the layout, choosing the materials, and ensuring everything works together seamlessly.

## 2. Breaking AI’s Constraints: Building the Tools of Tomorrow

AI operates within the boundaries of the tools, languages, and frameworks we provide it. While it’s great at picking the best options available today, these tools themselves are **a constraint**. To push performance to the next level, the market will demand entirely **new tools**.

- We’ll need **new languages**, **high-performance libraries**, **advanced DBMS**, and **innovative frameworks**.
- These tools will be created specifically to unlock AI’s potential further, helping it build applications that are more **efficient, scalable, and effective**.

> Picture this - AI as a master chef in a bustling kitchen, capable of creating incredible dishes. But the chef is limited by the tools at hand—dull knives, worn-out pans, and a stove that doesn’t heat evenly. To truly unlock the chef’s potential and elevate the cuisine, we need to innovate—design sharper knives, better cookware, and advanced kitchen equipment. Only with these new tools can the chef create masterpieces that weren’t possible before.

### 3. AI and the New Survival Game: Raising the Industry Standard

AI automation will inevitably eliminate many repetitive or low-skill jobs. That’s the reality. But what this also means is that people will be **forced to level up**. AI is reshaping the industry’s minima.

- Take jobs like cashiers, customer support, or call centers—once automated, these roles will vanish. But that will push people to learn **something extra**, go deeper, and move into more advanced roles.
- It’s about adapting to survive. Just like our grandparents who wanted to see their grandchildren—when video calls became the way, they learned how to use WhatsApp. They mastered smartphones not because they loved technology but because the **urge to connect** drove them.
- Similarly, those whose jobs are replaced by AI will have to **learn advanced skills** to stay relevant. It’s not just about survival; it’s about growing into roles that AI can’t handle.

### Final Thoughts

AI isn’t just changing how we work—it’s changing the kind of work we do. Development as we know it is being automated, which means the focus will be on architecture, design, and innovation. The tools we rely on today won’t be enough for tomorrow’s challenges, so we’ll need to reinvent them. And for everyone whose roles are automated, it’ll mean stepping up, learning more, and adapting to a new reality.

This isn’t the end of opportunities—it’s just the beginning of a new way of working.
