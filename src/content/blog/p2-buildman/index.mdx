# Diary
Inspiration - Bolt.new ( opensoure project )

steps carried out
- setup backend with express
- integrate claude API
- learned how to stream messages ( fetch data that is ready to be consumed) 
- went through how bolt works by inspectiving the network tab
-- whenever a users enters a prompt - bolt first makes an API call to /template endpoint to get the initial project setup as the requirements ( this part of code is not opensourced )
-- then bolt send api calls with 3 prompts 
--- 1. whatever you build, make sure its beautiful, 
--- 2. the initial project setup files received from above template
--- 3. the prompt entered by the user to build xyz application with xyz
